Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, node.js, Express.
When I got the project I started of a bit overzealous and tried out about every styling options possible. The result was the worst thing I had ever seen. So, I deleted the project and started over.
I am still very new to development so it took me a some time to get started, I designed a navbar with a brand name and the customer support tab which is clickable and redirects the user to call a phone number.
The navbar I designed is similar to Instacar's website.
Below that is a background image with a button which allows the user to book a car.
If the user chooses to book a car, they are redirected to a page which has a form which takes the user input for the origin city,  origin address, destination, destination address, dates for the trip and a button to book a cab.
The styles used in the website a minimal and the backend is pretty much non-existant as I just started learning node.js
