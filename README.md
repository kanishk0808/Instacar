When I got the project I started of a bit overzealous and tried out about every styling options possible. The result was the worst thing I had ever seen. So, I deleted the project and started over.

I am still very new to development so it took me a some time to get started, I designed a navbar with a brand name and the customer support tab which is clickable and redirects the user to call a phone number.

The navbar I designed is similar to Instacar's website.
Below that is a background image with a button which allows the user to book a car.

If the user chooses to book a car, they are redirected to a page which has a form which takes the user input for the origin city,  origin address, destination, destination address, dates for the trip and a button to book a cab.

The Origin and Destination tab have an autocomplete function, which was challenging, I wanted to integrate an api but it was a crash and burn and so I could not calculate the distance between the Origin and Destination cities. In the end I used a json file to suggest all the city names. It is all in the front end of the website so it makes the website lighter and hence faster, but that might just be me looking at the silver lining.

The styles used in the website a minimal and the backend is not the most elegent of works as I just started learning node.js and everything I know about backend I learnt during this project.
